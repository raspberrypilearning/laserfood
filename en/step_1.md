## Introduction

Laser cutters have become a staple of hackspaces across the UK, usually employed to produce plywood boxes, acrylic constructions, and engraved signage. It’s easy to use them for making in the kitchen, and it can result in some unique and beautiful edibles. It can be really fun to use tools with unintended materials, and you can end up with some really funky makes, (or just some piles of junk!) 

### The Hackspace bake-off

Generally speaking, there are two ways of using stencils in the kitchen. The first is to paint an edible adhesive (glucose or golden syrup) through the stencil, remove it, and then apply whatever you’d like to on top. This works well on cakes and with heavier sprinkles. The second is to hold the stencil above the item, and sprinkle something through. This tends to work best for decorating sticky items (self-adhesive if you will), and if you want to sprinkle powder. 

It’s important to choose your materials carefully – you don’t want to poison anyone if you can avoid it! If you’re painting through, you need your material to be waterproof, food safe, and (ideally) flexible. Mylar is one such material (though at the time of writing is only certified as food safe in the US, not the EU). Whilst it can brown a little when cutting, once you’ve got the settings spot, on you can limit this. It’s also easy to clean after use. You can pick sheets up from a variety of places on the internet – eBay is a good source. 

For rigid stencils, you just need material that’s not going to contaminate what you’re sprinkling through (it won’t touch the food). Cardboard works fine for this. 

### What you'll need

* A laser cutter
* Computer with 2D CAD software (inkscape and/or QCAD are good, free ones)
* Food-safe sheet material 
* Washing up equipment
* Edible adhesive
* Cocoa powder, hundreds-and-thousands or other sprinkling medium
